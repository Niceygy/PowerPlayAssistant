This is a 3D scatter plot rendered using webGL using on mobile phone accelerometer data.  You can change view by rotating cube using the mouse.  At present there's no relationship between the colours of the particles.

The visualisation uses the fantastic [threejs library](http://threejs.org/) for the 3D and hooks into webGL.  The example presented here is heavily based on the threejs scatter plot example.  I've also used [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) for some of convenience functions to import the data, scale the data and set up the ranges for the axis's.
